# Debt and gap register

Every known gap, shortcut, or blocked requirement has an entry here. A ledger requirement with `status: blocked` must cite one of these IDs (`scripts/check-substrate.ts` enforces it). Close an entry only with a cited commit and passing gate; do not delete it — mark it **Closed**.

Format: `## DEBT-NNN — title`, then **Status**, **Requirement(s)**, **Observed**, **Consequence**, **Exit criterion**.
